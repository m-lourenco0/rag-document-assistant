    "question": "What is the complete, step-by-step procedure for correctly attaching the lead cable to the motor's receptacle?",
    "ground_truth_answer": "To properly attach the lead cable, you must first align the protrusion on the cable with the notch on the receptacle. Insert the cable until it is fully seated and bottoms out. Before threading the connection nut, ensure its set screw is backed out to prevent scratching the cable. Place the nut and turn it counter-clockwise until you feel a click, which indicates the threads are properly meshed and prevents cross-threading. Hand-tighten the nut, then use a wrench to achieve the specific tightening torque listed on the UL certification tag attached to the cable. Finally, tighten the set screw on the nut to prevent it from loosening.",
    "ground_truth_references": [
      "To insure the cable is properly mated to the receptacle, the receptacle has a notch and the cable insert has a pro-trusion that will align with the notch.",

    "question": "What are the maximum operating submergence depth and pressure limits for the submersible motors?",
    "ground_truth_answer": "The maximum submergence for the motor should not go beyond 160 feet (49 meters) in depth. For motors with Tandem Seal designs, the maximum external motor seal pressure is 100 PSI (690 kpas). For motors with slurry seal designs, the maximum external motor seal pressure is significantly lower, at 15 PSI (103 kpas).",

    "question": "Explain the submersible motor's moisture protection system, including its key components and how it detects moisture.",
    "ground_truth_answer": "The moisture protection system features a non-wicking cable cap assembly and dual moisture sensing probes. The cable cap assembly is designed to stop moisture from wicking through the cable, even if the cable jacket is punctured. The dual moisture sensing probes are positioned in an oil chamber between tandem mechanical seals. If the outer seal fails, water enters this chamber and mixes with the oil. A separate leakage detector control, such as an Ametek APT Series 8040MD, applies voltage to these probes. The presence of water in the oil increases conductivity, which raises the current flow in the probe circuit, triggering an alarm. It is mandatory to connect this leakage detector system for the warranty and U/L listing to be valid.",

    "question": "How should a qualified person check and correct the rotation direction for a three-phase submersible motor?",
    "ground_truth_answer": "To check and correct the rotation of a three-phase motor, first, ensure all power is turned off and locked out, and verify there is zero voltage at the motor starter connectors. The motor shaft must be disconnected from the load. Momentarily apply power to observe the direction of the shaft's rotation. If the rotation is incorrect, turn off and lock out all power again, confirming zero voltage at the motor leads. To reverse the direction, interchange any two of the three motor power leads at the motor starter. Finally, restore power to verify the rotation is now correct before turning off the power again for final load connection.",

    "question": "According to the manual, what precautions must be taken when lifting and handling the submersible motor?",
    "ground_truth_answer": "When handling the motor, you must never lift, raise, or lower it by its power cords, as this can severely damage the lead connections and water seals. The motor should only be lifted using the provided lifting eyes. When lifting, a spreader bar is the preferred method to evenly distribute the force. If a spreader bar is not used, the angle of the lift rope must not be greater than 45 degrees from vertical to avoid damaging the motor. The motor must be stored with its shaft pointing down in its original packaging until it is ready to be installed.",

    "question": "How are the thermal protectors (thermostats) intended to be connected, and what specific type of protection do they provide?",
    "ground_truth_answer": "The thermostat leads, marked P1 and P2, must be connected in series with the stop button of the magnetic motor controller's 3-wire pilot circuit. They are automatic reset thermostats designed for a normally closed circuit, where they are in series with the magnetic starter's holding coil. These thermostats provide 'Over Temperature' protection as defined by NEMA MG 1-12.53, opening the circuit before the motor reaches dangerous temperatures. However, they do not provide protection against winding over-temperature conditions caused by a locked rotor; separate over-current protection is suggested for that purpose.",
