    "question": "Describe the procedure for preparing a gear unit for long-term storage, defined as a period longer than 9 months.",
    "ground_truth_answer": "To prepare a gear unit for storage longer than 9 months, you must first remove all humidity from the gear unit and any associated cooling system. Check the oil level and add the recommended lubricant if necessary. For units with oil, add a VCI anticorrosive agent at 2% of the lubricant's capacity and turn the shafts. For units without oil, mix 10% of the total recommended lubricant volume with 2% VCI additive and add it to the unit. Seal the gear unit completely by closing air holes and taping around the dipstick. Apply grease around the shafts near the lip seals and wrap these areas with adhesive tape. Finally, inspect and protect external fastening surfaces with an appropriate anticorrosive agent if their protective film is damaged.",

    "question": "What are the proper procedures for handling and moving gear units or gearmotors?",
    "ground_truth_answer": "When moving gear units or gearmotors, always use appropriate ropes, lifting slings, and equipment to ensure safety. The equipment should be moved using the lifting eyebolt. If no eyebolt is present, lift the unit via the gear unit housing in conjunction with the motor's eyebolt, ensuring the angle between the cables does not exceed 60 degrees. Never lift the equipment by the motor alone. Before lifting, confirm the load is properly balanced, and handle the unit smoothly to prevent impacts, especially to the shaft ends.",

      "For moving and handling gear units/gearmotors, use proper ropes, lifting slings and lifting equipment so as not to put people and the equipment itself at risk.",
      "The gear units/gearmotors must be moved using the lifting eyebolt (Fig. 2A) and, if eyebolt is not present, the unit must be lifted through the gear unit housing (Fig.2B), together with the eyebolt of the motor (Fig.2C) observing the maximum angle of 60° between the cables.",

    "question": "According to the troubleshooting guide, what are the potential causes and corrective measures for a gear unit exhibiting excessive noise and vibration?",
    "ground_truth_answer": "For excessive noise and vibration, the manual identifies three main causes: \n1. **Irregularities on the mounting screws or inverted installation:** Check the alignment of the unit and any shims. Tighten the screws and ensure anchors are firm in the foundation. \n2. **Fault on the rolling bearings (due to fatigue, dirt, or overload):** Replace worn bearings, clean the inside of the gear unit, and refill with new oil. Also, check and repair clearances, coupling alignment, and loads on the shafts. \n3. **Lack of oil or loss of parts:** Check the oil level and correct it. Inspect the gear unit for broken parts, missing screws, or damaged threads, and check the alignment with the driven machine.",
